# Moonwilly-Protocal



MoonWilly🐋🐋🐋 is a Certificate of Deposit built on the Binance Smart Chain. Each transaction, purchase or sell, incurs a 15% fee, distributed as follows:

### Tokenomics:
💰8% Static rewards in DAI (USD Stablecoin) is redistributed every 60 mins to MoonWilly Token holders. A Minimum of 10,000 MoonWilly tokens are needed to receive rewards. Why did we select DAI? Holders won’t need to be concerned about regulators freezing their assets or being blacklisted, as DAI is controlled by smart contracts. This is not true for USDC, USDT, and BUSD.

💧3% Liquidity Fee (sent back to the LP)

🗣3% Marketing, Development, Charity (MoonWilly Treasury)

☯️1% Burn per transaction to the burn wallet address (Black-Hole). The burn wallet address is blacklisted from receiving DAI (USD Stablecoin) rewards.

Additional features:

📈📉Additional 3% tax when selling to prevent from pump and dumps (1% goes to marketing, 1% BURN, 1% goes to LP)

🗑Anti-dump feature: max 0.1% of total supply can be sold at a time

🔒 Anti-Bot/Anti-Whale features in the contract at launch.
